 Identify the reasons for the lagging progress of the 5 students who are behind. Schedule one-on-one meetings with each of them to discuss their challenges and provide support.

2. Create a personalized plan for each of the 5 students who are behind, outlining specific tasks they need to complete to catch up with the rest of the class. Set realistic deadlines and check in with them regularly to monitor their progress.

3. Provide additional resources and support to help the 5 lagging students catch up, such as extra tutoring sessions or access to online learning materials.

4. For the 10 at-risk students, send out reminders about upcoming deadlines and offer additional support if needed. Consider setting up a peer mentoring program where more advanced students can offer guidance and support to those who are struggling.

5. Ensure that all students have access to the same resources and support, regardless of their progress in the bootcamp.

6. Monitor progress closely and adjust interventions as needed. Celebrate successes along the way and provide positive reinforcement to keep all students motivated and engaged in their learning journey.

7. Finally, communicate regularly with all stakeholders (students, instructors, program managers) about progress and any changes made to interventions or plans. This will help ensure that everyone is on the same page and working together towards a common goal - successful completion of the bootcamp for all students.
